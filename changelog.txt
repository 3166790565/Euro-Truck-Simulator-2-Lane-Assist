V0.1 - 8.8.2022

I HAVE NOT PERSONALLY TESTED THIS VERSION, but other people have gotten it to work.
This is due to having no wheel available to me at the time.

Added
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added a file in the models folder so it doesn't have to be made.
- Added comments to both main python files for easier editing and understanding of the code.
- The lane detection window is now resizeable.
- These added variables can only be changed by editing the python files, this can be done without
  any special program by for example opening the files with notepad.
- Added two new variables
    - maximumControl = 0.2
        - This changes the max value of the control signal between 0 and 1.
    - controlSmoothness = 2
        - How many smoothness iterations to do with the formula :  
        - oldValue = ((oldValue * smoothness + newValue) / (smoothness + 1))
- Added three new lane detection options.
    - previewOnTop = True
        - This toggle showing the lane detection window on top of other windows.
        - This will only change on startup.
    - computeGreenDots = True
        - This will toggle computing the green dots.
        - This might have some performance overhead so I will leave this as an option.
    - drawSteeringLine = True
        - This will toggle drawing of the red steering line.

Fixed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug that caused steering to not work when not using lane assist.
- Combined all LICENSE files to one (this should have been done from the start.
- Moved the variables to the top of the python files for easier editing.
- Updated readme to reflect recent changes and findings.
