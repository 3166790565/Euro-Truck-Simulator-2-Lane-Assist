# Version 1.2.1
(Previous Version 1.2.0)

# Small Changes
- Added the VirtualSimAPI to support games not developed by SCS (like BeamNG.drive)
    - Will set all values to default, this means that automatic blinkers etc... won't work.
- Added the ExternalAPI plugin for external applications.
    - It will export the app's data variable to localhost (127.0.0.1) at port 39847
    - Will be used for the Unity/Godot visualization later on
    - Also will provide the possibility for making a html based UI

# Background work
- The map plugin can now injest the new data from the game. It will still not do anything, there is no point in trying.

# Minor Changes
- Added lane departure warning.

# Bugfixes
- Fixed DefaultSteering spamming 
- Fixed UFLDDrawLanes spamming
