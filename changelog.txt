For earlier changelogs please join the discord or look at the github page!


# Version 1.2.0
(Previous Version 1.1.6)

# Major Changes
- The application can now be automatically translated into any language supported by Google Translate
    - Everything major should be translated. If anything is missing then please go ahead and tell me in the discord and I will fix it!
    - In the future I will add support for the other translations services like ChatGPT and DeepL (keep in mind you will have to have an API key for these)
    - This will hopefully pick your own operating system's language automatically, if it does not then again, please send a message in the #support channel.
    - KEEP IN MIND THAT THE APPLICATION IS DESIGNED FOR ENGLISH. 
        - There might be text and/or UI elements that are not where they should be when translating.

# Bug Fixes
- Made the evdev error more descriptive to hopefully alleviate issues with people identifying it as a problem.

# Version Labeling Changes
- I accidentally labeled all updates before this one as patches :skull:. From now on all updates with "Major Changes" are going to increment the minor version : 
    - 1.2.0
    - major.minor.patch 

# New Developer
- Please welcome @dtheicydragon as a new developer! (sorry for the ping xD)
    - He is still learning the app so when I'm not available please don't bother him too much for support requests :)
