### About

What is this app?
1. It was created for automatic driving in ETS2 and ATS. Right now it can stay in between the lanes.
2. Along the way I developed it to a complete plugin based application for sending information to and from ETS2 and ATS
    - This means that you can create your own plugins for the app, even if they are not related to driving.
    - It also means that development of future versions is easier and modular.


### What does it look like in action?

You can see the older [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHBFTHrOqCU).
Or a part of the installation [video](https://youtu.be/ILLqHix_D8o?t=518)



### How to use and install?

You can watch the latest installation video. Installation takes about 20 minutes. And then about 10 to tune in your own values.


### How to update?

You can run the update.bat script or go into `app/` and run `git pull`.


### How to contribute?

You can contribute by creating issues and pull requests. You can also contribute by creating plugins for the app.
The plugin infrastructure is going to get documentation in the future (see [Wiki](https://wiki.tumppi066.xyz/en/LaneAssist)).

For now you should be able to learn enough from the example plugin and panel (`app/plugins/Examples/`)


### I have issues / suggestions.

Please join the discord. 


### I want to support you.

You can contact me and we can discuss it. I am not keen on accepting support since I feel like that would mandate me to continue development.
I will focus on school first then the app.


### I want to use your app in my own app.

The license does indeed allow you to do that. As long as you keep all the copyright notices in place. Despite this I would appreciate if you did at least tell me about it. I'm eager to help anyone wanting to use my code and I will share my knowledge.

In addition it would be beneficial if you made a plugin instead of just copying the code. This way you can update the plugin without having to update the whole app.
To add to this I will implement all "base" features you want (for example more UI shortcuts etc...).
