"""
These docs are automatically created from the docstrings in the source code.
Not all plugins are documented, so you may not find what you're looking for without actually checking the code.

I will try and keep most of the documentation up to date, especially for the core files (src/)

### NOTE: You can always run the buildDocs.bat file to build the up to date docs from the source code.
