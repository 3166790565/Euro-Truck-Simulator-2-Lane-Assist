"""
These docs are automatically created from the docstrings in the source code.
Not all plugins are documented, so you may not find what you're looking for without actually checking the code.

I will try and keep most of the documentation up to date, especially for the core files (src/)

### NOTE: You can always run the buildDocs.bat file to build the up to date docs from the source code.

### How to add docs to your plugin
- If you want a description in the plugins list, then add an `__init__.py` file with a docstring to your plugin folder.
- For docs on global variables, similarly you will want to add a docstring there.
- For docs on functions, you will want to add a google formatted docstring to the function. An easy way to do this is using the autoDocstring extension for vscode.

TIP: Check the source on files that have docstrings, that's an easy way to check the format!
