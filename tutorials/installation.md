!!! Note
This page will be expanded in the future once the new installer is released. There is no reason for us to write a tutorial for something that is going to be replaced in a week or so :+1:

For now you can enjoy my extremely enthusiastic video tutorialðŸ‘Œ

## Manual Installation  
This is a guide for installing the app manually. Manual installation doesn't use any .exe or .bat files, but is also less convenient than the installer.

#### Step 1: Download python and git
=== Python
- Go to the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python 3.11 (as of writing this is [3.11.8](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.8/python-3.11.8-amd64.exe)).
- Make sure to enable **Add python to Path** during the installation.
- Other settings can be on default.
=== Git
- Go to the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the latest version of Git, or use [this link](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
